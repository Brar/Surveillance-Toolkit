= Introduction
== What are you reading here?
This document is the surveillance protocol for the core module of the NeoIPC surveillance which covers surveillance of nosocomial infections in Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) / Very Preterm (VPT) Infants.
It is part of a toolkit for the surveillance of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in neonatology that we developed within the NeoIPC project.
If you want to perform surveillance of early-onset infections or of nosocomial infections in infants with a birth weight above 1&#8239;500{nbsp}g and a gestational age greater than 32{nbsp}weeks, the toolkit provides additional methods that are covered in separate protocols.
