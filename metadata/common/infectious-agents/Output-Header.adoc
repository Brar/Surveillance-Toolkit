= NeoIPC Infectious Agent List

[.normal]
The following list contains the current taxonomic names and common synonyms of the infectious agent
species and genera as well as some diagnostic groups that can currently be recorded in the NeoIPC Surveillance.

Originally derived from the NHSN Organism List <<nhsn-organism-list>>, it is regularly updated with current
information from the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature <<lpsn>>,
the MycoBank database <<mycobank>> and the ICTV database <<ictv>>.

We thank these organisations for generously publishing their data under a permissive licence, enabling its use in
the NeoIPC Surveillance.
